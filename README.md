## Overview

[The Tanker SDK](https://tanker.io) provides an easy-to-use SDK allowing you to protect your users'
data.

The Tanker Native SDK is the base of the [Tanker Android SDK](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-android) and the [Tanker iOS SDK](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-ios).

It exposes a C++ and a C API. None of them are, to this day, considered stable.

### Setup

We are actively working to allow external developers to build and test this sdk from its source.

## Contributing

We welcome feedback. Feel free to open any issue on the Github bug tracker.
