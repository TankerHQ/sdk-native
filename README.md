# Encryption SDK for C++ / C

[Overview](#overview) · [Contributing](#contributing) · [License](#license)

## Overview

Tanker is an open-source client SDK that can be embedded in any application.

It leverages powerful **client-side encryption** of any type of data, textual or binary, but without performance loss and assuring a **seamless end-user experience**. No cryptographic skills are required.

The Tanker Native SDK exposes C++ and C APIs, that are wrapped in our [Android](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/TankerHQ/sdk-ios) SDKs.

## Contributing

We welcome feedback. Feel free to open any issue on the Github bug tracker.

We are actively working to allow external developers to build and test this sdk from its source.
